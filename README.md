This is a proposition of survey to describe a sub-community in the STEM field. It is of open access and can be used freely.
The objective is analyzing the demographics,  representation, and social behavior of a group of people. 
In particular, this survey can be used to identify under-represented sub-groups and inappropriate habits or behaviors.
It addresses different social characteristics:
- the general demographics of the sample of people to which the survey is addressed,
- the visibility and the ability of the participants to self-promote during a specific social event (ex: conference),
- their visibility and their recognition in the field in general,
- and the occurrence of unprofessional behaviors in this community.

This survey was developed and first used at the Spirit of Lyot conference held in 2019 in Tokyo, Japan.
